The name of the game is survive, the main idea is player controls the character to survive as long as possible. Player got 5 lives, mean you can touch mushroom 5 times until you die. And can use button V to toggle trees and rock.
           
Character actions: jump, move left and right, climb->yellow tree, push down green tree.
Kick mushroom back(if you use head and jump to do that, it is a good push).

Player action: button “V” can switch the appearance of rock or green tree.if you lose 5 lives, you die, and the timer shows how long you survives.


Objects: yellow tree->character can climb on, push “v” to hide it or show it.   
Green tree->character can push it down, then go across the river. 
Rock->push “v” to hide it or show it.
Platform->character can go through it and can land on it.
mushroom->chase character until character die.
bush->slow player’s speed.

Game Strategy: ran around to evade mushroom. If you stuck somewhere or very close to mushroom. You can jump off the platform-> you respawn but lives does not change.
Or kick mushroom further, then you get higher chance to escape.

Future: put it in 2.5 D model, looks more beautiful. 
Create rank system, which allow players to compare their results.
Restructure the objects,make different levels. to make it more fun.
